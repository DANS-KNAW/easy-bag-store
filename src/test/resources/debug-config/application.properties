### General settings ###

#
# The base URL to use for local-file-uri's. This should normally be http://localhost.
#
bag-store.local-file-uri-base=http://localhost

#
# When transforming a UUID to the container path for a bag in the bag store, the slashes will
# form path components with the sizes in the configured list. The numbers must therefore add
# up to 32, which is the total length of a UUID when written out in hexadecimal (without dashes).
#
# Example: the pattern 8,8,16 will set up easy-bag-store to convert
#
#   59be6864-81ce-42cf-b671-1b8b2cf73705
#
# into
#
#   59be6864/81ce42cf/b6711b8b2cf73705
#
bag-store.uuid-slash-pattern=2,30

#
# The POSIX file permissions to set on directories (including the bag's base directory) and regular
# files. The permissions should disallow any modification of the bags, but give enough privileges
# for the bag store to operate. For example the "execute" permission on directories is necessary for
# being able to list the contents of a directory.
#

# !!NOTE: for convenience (i.e. easier deletion) the settings in this debug-conf have been changed
# to allow writing in the bag store

bag-store.bag-file-permissions=rwxrwx---
bag-store.bag-dir-permissions=rwxrwx---

#
# Directory for staging bags for adding and retrieving from a bag store. This directory must be on
# the same partition as the bag store. The reason for this is that the ADD action must be atomic.
# To achieve this, each bag that is staged for addition to the bag store whill be moved. However,
# only a move within a partition is atomic.
#
bag-store.staging.base-dir=data/


### HTTP daemon settings ####

#
# Port to listen on.
#
daemon.http.port=20110

#
# The base URL for clients to connect to. When configuring the daemon for machine-external connections,
# this must be changed, for example to http://bagstore.example.com/ if your daemon is listening on
# port 80 of the host bagstore.example.com.
#
daemon.external-base-uri=http://localhost:20110/


### Command line client settings ###

#
# Items retrieved from a bag store with the command line client will have their permissions changed
# to reflect the following settings. While the items in the bag store should remain read-only, you
# probably want the retrieved items to be writable.
#
cli.output.bag-file-permissions=rwxrwxr-x
cli.output.bag-dir-permissions=rwxrwxr-x
